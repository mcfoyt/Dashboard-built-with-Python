# Dashboard-built-with-Python
An example of a dashboard I made for a client that would take their linkedin data. It can be hosted like a website and can show data in real time. The filler data is hard coded as 
an example of the project. I make the appropriate changes to show data from other platforms or services. This is just a solid template.

To see the project, get the code and run it in your environment. A local host will appear, click that and you'll see the example dashboard!
